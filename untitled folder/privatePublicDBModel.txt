Multi user

make all user music folders available seperatly

Make one DB that stores everything
  Make seperate libraries that can import from different DBs


Need a seperate table that logs update times


====================================================================================
Beets DB
  Create and store hash of each private DB, and a last updated timestamp

  Compare DB hashes
    If different, scan private DB for fields added after timestamp
    Add all new fields to public DB


Built In DB
  Spawn new process
    Process all newly added files
    Add new files to both private user DB and public shared DB



================================================================================
The Private/Public DB model

Each user stores a private sqlite3DB (or maybe something else)
When a filescan is done, both the private DB is updated
An mstream plugin can read the private DB and insert it into a shared public DB
  public DBs can easily be created and destroyed to change expanding server needs



HOSTING
Private DBs are mamaged by beets
Public DBs are managed by MySQL

MSTREAM EXPRESS
NO Private DBS
All users files are managed in one big public DB



====================================================================================
All Scenarios:

User is using mstream for everything
sqlite for public and private db

User is is using sqlite3 for public DB, and beets for private database

Mysql for public DB, beets for private db

Mysql for public and private

Bonus: Custom javascript DB (ex: http://lokijs.org/#/) for everything
